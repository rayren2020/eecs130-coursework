        <h2>Goldman Sachs Stock Pitch Competition</h2><h3>April 2019</h3>
        <p>My team pitched a ‘Sell’ recommendation for Veeva (VEEV) before the Goldman Securities Division in Chicago. Veeva is a SaaS company
          serving the pharmeceutical and life sciences industry, and our investment thesis focused on slowing subscription revenue growth, increasing competitive threats,
          and downside implied by DCF valuation.</p>

        <h2>Venture Capital Investment Competition</h2><h3>March 2019</h3>
        <p>I organized and led a team at a mock-VC competition, where we conducted due diligence on real startups, drafted a term sheet and cap table, and presented before VC judges.
        We recommended investing in a real estate tech app that enabled first-time homebuyers to save in an intuitive way. The company provided matching credit to app users,
        and sold high quality leads to mortgage lenders and brokers.</p>

        <h2>Northwestern Capital Management</h2><h3>March 2019</h3>
        <p>My team pitched a 'Buy' recommendation for Guidewire, a property and casualty insurance software provider, due to its growing recurring revenue stream,
        opportunity to upsell add-on modules to existing clients, and sticky product from high switching costs.</p>
